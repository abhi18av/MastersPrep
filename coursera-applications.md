## Why you need?

I am a University graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I couldn't secure a job during the college placements because of low grades but that's not to say that I don't like to learn. In fact, I'm absolutely in love with learning and I value my education a lot. 

I wish to pursue my masters in Amsterdam, in Language and Logic stream. Languages have always been a great passion of mine but being from an Indian middle class income group the fees for the course weighs heavy on my family.  

Apart from languages, if there's anything I love and can absolutely do for a living are games which are a wonderful combination of Imagination, Art and Storytelling. If I am to pursue my masters and create a meaningful and independent career I need to hone my artistic side and to work hard on my skills. 

I wish to be able to support myself and my education without being a burden for my family.


## how this course?

I don't wish to be yet another lousy IT professional from India but I wish to be able to use computers and the digital world as an expression of my thought and perspective. I'd like to develop games for making a living, which involve a huge element of Art, Design and Storytelling. 

Through this course I wish to liberate the need for an office and instead to be able to work in a Location-Independent manner. In today's fast paced world, only digital art and technological know-how offers me that freedom. I sincerely believe that, this course will give me the confidence to trust the artist within me. 

At the moment, I'm in desperate need of means to make a decent living so that I may pursue my dreams and education. 

I need this course on Storytelling to become better as a Creative person, which I've found to be vital part of learning.

## reasons
As I've explained above, being unemployed and from a family of modest means, essentially makes courses a luxury for me. It's through Coursera that I'm designing my own education with the goal to learn as much as I can.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to pay for this specialization as of now. But, I do wish to give back in terms of translations and community partnership.

I sincerely wish that Coursera team and the University authorities would consider me worthy of this course.
