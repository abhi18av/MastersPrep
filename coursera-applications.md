## Why you need?

I am a University graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. I couldn't secure a job during the college placements because of low grades but that's not to say that I don't like to learn. In fact, I'm absolutely in love with learning and I value my education a lot. 

I wish to pursue my masters in Amsterdam, in Language and Logic stream. Languages have always been a great passion of mine but being from an Indian middle class income group the fees for the course weighs heavy on my family.  

Apart from languages, if there's anything I love and can absolutely do for a living are games which are a wonderful combination of Imagination, Art and Storytelling. If I am to pursue my masters and create a meaningful and independent career I need to hone my artistic side and to work hard on my skills. 

I wish to be able to support myself and my education without being a burden for my family.

I am a University graduate with a Bachelor's in Computer Science. During my university placements, I felt nauseated since everyone was just opting for a bigger placements package ( job offer) without ever questioning their line of action - Why this company, why this job?

Then towards the end of my University life I got involved into a startup and ended up founding the company of my own. A year later, there were a lot of regrets and the startup was eventually a still born. I wish to understand Why? What went wrong?  - How can I do better next time?

I'm absolutely in love with learning and I value my education a lot and now that I have some free time on my hands I'd love to learn from the "Startup Nation" and to become competent enough to carry things out the next time. In the meantime, I wish to pursue my masters in Amsterdam, in Language and Logic stream.

## reasons
As I've explained above, being unemployed and from a family of modest means, essentially makes courses a luxury for me. It's through Coursera that I'm designing my own education with the goal to learn as much as I can.

Unfortunately, I'm not able to pay for this specialization as of now. But, I do wish to give back in terms of translations and community partnership.

I sincerely wish that Coursera team and the University authorities would consider me worthy of this course.
