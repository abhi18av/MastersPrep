# Computational Linguistics

Dear ... goed morgen..

 
The reason that I'm interested in this course, Masters in Language and Logic, has many factors behind it or maybe just one - endless fascination.

I've always found language to be such a beautiful and suspiciously simple thing, and yet it's there in every fabric of our lives - social as well as the inner life. Encompassing ages, borders and cultures. 

The dice of fate was such that I was born in a country which the life is rich in intimate relationships, huge families and months full of diverse festivals - India. But the current educational culture of the society has been a result of chaotic time where on one hand being studious is held in high regards but at the same time there's this notion of "practical and prestigious professions" like being an Engineer, Civil servant, Doctor, Business professionals, Computer professionals etc and on the other hand the "all too theoretical professions" like Archeologists, Linguists, Mathematicians, Physicists, Biologists. Let alone the professions in Arts and Music...

The reason that I mention this background is that, as a society, the focus on a career is not a pursuit for the sake of knowledge but for the sake of a socially acceptable and a comfortable life so that we may have a "safe and secure" future, a respectable white collar job. This is completely overlooking the fact that most of the "practical" professions build solely upon the foundations laid by the people involved in pursuit of knowledge. Which is another way of saying that here, work is something that keeps life "modern" and comfortable till the next big social event be it marriage, a religious festival or a new phase in one's life, I know that our week-long ceremonies are famous all around so that's how important celebrations are in our lives. 

I do not complain about this, in fact I'm happy that I've experience the wonderfully strong relationship amidst big families but I've always felt that there is something more to life than this, I've always had this thirst for understanding and being involved in something more profound than just the human-centric lives we live.


To me that has been about languages, or more accurately what they do and can still reveal about our essence. After all, we don't have the biggest paws or the strongest jaws nor do we have any extraordinary physical trait that distinguishes us from the billions of other species, we have shared our home with. Still, beyond the superficial "differences" we are all quite the same. Then what is it that separates us, that made us - us?

It's our minds, not only the physical aspect of our intellect but our imagination, the part that could only be expressed using 

I let myself get distracted in the startUp frenzy...but this strange yearning..of being able to think and to seek for something profound... My mind is hungry and it'd be bad conscience on my part to overlook this "seeker" part of my identity...


Most of education that I've had in college - a more accurate description would be my professor's words and my college projects ... they were all based on languages and since this was a first in indian tech. university ( rare ) she gave me the freedom to work on what truly interests me... I did work on Paul Chilton's on my own...found funcitonal programming .. church/godel/turing etc to be at the heart of it... some kind of geometry maybe..or even something like an automaton of language...something that can still lead to all the surface varieties we can think of...it's like the time before mendeleev in chemistly...thger's still so much more we can learn ... 

I know that there have been recent advances made in the field of "learning languages" which still is better than the "statistical approaches " we've used thus far.. perhaps there's a better way to reason about languages.. some sort of cellular automata that begins from simple rules and yet forms a language - maybe there's such a thing as a minimal turing complete langauge etc...I know these are all speculative but I believe that this course would lead me to a better understanding..would allow me to seek the right question first and with perseverence to  the right answers...

I left out two years - most my peers graduated ahead of me.. because it had an intrinsic meaning ... my college grades would hardly reflect what I've learned but I learned as an autodidact...

Why I wish to study in Netherlands..i need my people..a tribe I can really resonate with...here, the best career would be to join IT firm...I'd be a lousy engineer...or "prestigious" job like IAS..teachers are not respected at all... etc but that's hardly sojmething my heart years for...it lacks meaning for me...I feel that in Netherlands..alaways been forward looking and tolerant ...especially with environment... right from the time of Spinoza..a long tradition of excellence... a distant second would be doing "computatoinal linguistics" or some such-  but this course .. is my dream one... I shall never learn something as deep as this course and the colleagues would drive me to ... it's about a community...

I wish to pursue things which give me profound joy in and of themselves ... langauges are sufficiently people oriented for me.. I love intereacting iwth people and intellucally instigating for me...


I've always believed that, we as a race, are more like gardners ... two trees ... this is my way of helping them flourish.


Gerard 't hooft or erik meijer " Computer Scientists don't know their history!"... I deeply feel that great work is being done in linguistics in Europe and Netherlands is at the heart of it, with Germany a deserving neighbor.

verbs are like the prime numbers of loangauges ...
