Dear ... goed morgen..

I'd like to 

The reason that I'm interested in this course, Masters in Logic is that 

I've always found language to be such a beautiful and suspiciously simple thing - and yet it's there in every fabric of our lives - social as well as the inner life. 

I know that there have been recent advances made in the field of "learning languages" which still is better than the "statistical approaches " we've used thus far.. perhaps there's a better way to reason about languages.. some sort of cellular automata that begins from simple rules and yet forms a language - maybe there's such a thing as a minimal turing complete langauge etc...I know these are all speculative but I believe that this course would lead me to a better understanding..would allow me to seek the right question first and with perseverence to  the right answers...


Most of education that I've had in college - a more accurate description would be my professor's words and my college projects ... they were all based on languages and since this was a first in indian tech. university ( rare ) she gave me the freedom to work on what truly interests me... I did work on Paul Chilton's on my own...found funcitonal programming .. church/godel/turing etc to be at the heart of it... some kind of geometry maybe..or even something like an automaton of language...something that can still lead to all the surface varieties we can think of...it's like the time before mendeleev in chemistly...thger's still so much more we can learn ... 

I let myself get distracted in the startUp frenzy...but this strange yearning..of being able to think and to seek for something profound... My mind is hungry and it'd be bad conscience on my part to overlook this "seeker" part of my identity...

I left out two years - most my peers graduated ahead of me.. because it had an intrinsic meaning ... my college grades would hardly reflect what I've learned but I learned as an autodidact...

Why I wish to study in Netherlands..i need my people..a tribe I can really resonate with...here, the best career would be to join IT firm...I'd be a lousy engineer...or "prestigious" job like IAs etc but that's hardly sojmething my heart years for...it lacks meaning for me...I feel that in Netherlands..alaways been forward looking and tolerant ... right from the time of Spinoza..a long tradition of excellence... a distant second would be doing "computatoinal linguistics" or some such-  but this course .. is my dream one... I shall never learn something as deep as this course and the colleagues would drive me to ... it's about a community...

I wish to pursue things which give me profound joy in and of themselves ... langauges are sufficiently people oriented for me.. I love intereacting iwth people and intellucally instigating for me...
