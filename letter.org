Good Morning,
 
The reason that I'm interested in this course, Masters in Language and Logic, has many factors behind it or maybe just one - endless fascination.

I've always found language to be such a beautiful and suspiciously simple thing, and yet it's there in every fabric of our lives - social as well as the inner life. Encompassing – borders, Cultures and Time.

The dice of fate was such that I was born in a country which the life is rich in intimate relationships, huge families and months full of diverse festivals - India. But the current educational culture of the society has been a result of chaotic time where on one hand being studious is held in high regards but at the same time there's this notion of "practical and prestigious professions" like being an Engineer, Civil servant, Doctor, Business professionals, Computer professionals etc and on the other hand the "all too theoretical professions" like Archeologists, Linguists, Mathematicians, Physicists, Biologists. Let alone the professions in Arts and Music...

The reason that I mention this background is that, as a society, the focus on a career is not a pursuit for the sake of knowledge but for the sake of a socially acceptable and a comfortable life so that we may have a "safe and secure" future, a respectable white collar job. 

I do not complain about this, in fact I'm happy that I've experience the wonderfully strong relationship amidst big families but I've always felt that there is something more to life than this, I've always had this thirst for understanding and being involved in something more profound than just the human-centric lives we live.


To me that has been about languages, or more accurately, what they do and can still reveal about our essence. After all, we don't have any extraordinary physical trait that distinguishes us from the billions of other species, we have shared our home with. Still, beyond the superficial "differences" we are all quite the same. Then what is it that separates us, that made us - us?

It's our minds, not only the physical aspect of our intellect but our imagination, our creativity, the part that could be expressed using so many means but most clearly and widely expressed as languages. The sheer variety of them! We might not be the greatest of species, but we are great learners. Languages have been time capsules in form of traditions, stories etc helping to keep us together and build upon the work done by our ancestors. Still, it gives us the tools to innovate at our whim. There’s a deeper question - what do they represent?  Perhaps, they are the hint to a deeper truth about our nature, our essence.

A more accurate description of my knowledge and drive would be my professor's words and my college projects. They were all based on languages and since this was a first in the University, she gave me the freedom to work on what truly interests me, with plenty of guidance. Be it NLP analysis of tweets to gauge National Sentiment on Government bans or an exploratory work on the theory of Paul Chilton about Language, Space and Mind.

Through these, I've realized that the logical foundations of CS is much the same as that of Mathematics and Linguistics. The recent "statistical approaches", "neural networks" have proven good - but perhaps there's a better way to reason about languages. Some kind of linguistic cellular automata that begins from simple rules and yet forms a language, maybe there's such a thing as a minimal Turing complete "natural" language etc. I know this is all speculative but I believe that this course would lead me to a better understanding and would allow me to seek the right question first, and with perseverence, to the right answers.

Why I wish to study in Netherlands?

The simplest answer being - a tribe.

I seek people I can really communicate with. I feel that in Netherlands, a country that has always been forward looking with a long tradition of excellence. Apart from this course, a distant second would be doing "Computational Linguistics",  but this course Logic and Language is my dream one. I shall never learn something as deep as this course and the colleagues would drive me to, it's about a community.

In no other place shall I be able to entertain, "Verbs are like the prime numbers of languages"
