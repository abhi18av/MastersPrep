UNIVERSITY PROJECTS =>

I've been engaged in modeling language as projects for the University examinations. 

1. Minor-1, was based upon learning the usage of NLTK library from Python ecosystem. And we did a basic sentiment analysis.

2. Minor-2, was based upon the MATHEMATICA ( WOLFRAM ) language and through this language I explored the theories proposed by Noam Chomsky.

3. Major-1, was based upon real time sentiment analysis of Twitter feeds using Python and NLTK. Moreover, we co-related them to the banning spree that the Indian government embarked upon. We tried to co-relate the reaction of people from a state to how accurately their opinions were echoed by the member of parliament from that state.

4. Major-2, we explored the theories put forward by Paul Chilton in his 2014 book "Language, Space and Mind". The best tool we found, for further work was a functional programming language like Haskell, Clojure or F#.
